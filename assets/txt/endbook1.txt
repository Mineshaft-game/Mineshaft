Today I found a strange underground tunnel system. For some reason it had a library. I was able to salvage a strange book containing a whole lot of words and definitions in the library. The rest was either decayed, like the walls, or were so old, they crumbled within my hands. I was able to read one entry before it crumbled like the others, though.
Mitosis
A type of cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number and type of chromosomes as the parent nucleus. 
Seems important to write down, seeing how it's in a place this ancient.I'll try to find some meaning in this later. This is Brine, signing out.

Later note: I found out what it could have been referring to. Maybe that's how the Shulkers of the End dimension took over so quickly. All it took was one to divide and embed itself within the purple bricks for the chain reaction to start. Anyway, that's all I have for my journal today. Signing out.
